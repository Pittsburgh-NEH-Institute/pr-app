            <p>This document is part of a larger digital collection of stories of ghost hoaxes from
               the 18th and 19th century London newspapers and periodicals. The project explores the
               beginnings of mass print media in a metropolitan area at a time when technology and
               education made reading increasingly common and inexpensive.</p>
            <p>The corpus holds 36 individual documents, which reflect a diverse mix of reporting on
               various hauntings in and around London between 1804 and 1889. The PDF and JPEGs from
               online databases were transcribed using ABBYFineReader OCR, then corrected and
               occasionally manually transcribed if document quality necessitated it. After
               normalization in plain text, all documents were upconverted to TEI XML.</p>

               <p>Earlier texts have had some spelling normalization due to errors in OCR.
                  Typographic em dashes are longer than modern em dashes, so all dashes have been
                  normalized to modern em dash length.</p>

         <p>All the world has by this time heard of the <placeName ref="#london">London</placeName> Ghost, who is known in the suburbs,
            by the name of <q><rs ref="springheeledjack">Spring-heeled Jack</rs>,</q> who has been
            jumping Jim Crow in our neighbourhood in rather a novel style. Various conjectures are
            afloat respecting this solemn, grave looking personage. Some say it is <persName ref="#springrice">Spring
               Rice</persName>, <rs ref="pol">who has taken this opportunity of diverting the minds of the people
            from political scrutiny, and financial investigations</rs>. Others again say it is <persName ref="#johnrussell">Jack
            Russell</persName>, on the secret service of the Home Department; others, <persName ref="#henrybrougham">Lord Brougham</persName>, looking
            for glow-worms to enlighten the people, We cannot say we agree with any of these popular
            rumours. We have too much faith in ghosts, to doubt the possibility of its being a
               <q>genevine bony fidy</q> spirit incarnate, sent from Tartar-us to warn the sinful
            inhabitants of this land of <rs ref="pol">the coming judgments of the Devil, for their awful
            selfishness and grasping greediness, by which they suck the blood of the poor, and
            fasten upon the produce of their industry, with their savage claws</rs>. The rumours that
            prevail about a wager between some wealthy scamps of aristocracy are much too
            imaginative and incredible for our sober minds. Who the d--e could make boots for a
            sham-appariton that would enable the wearer to jump over garden walls and fly over the
            tops of houses, to ride across the weathercocks of churches and to peep in at the back
            window of a house at the very moment he was knocking at the front door, and frightening
            the maid into her inward senses? This is an age of discovery, truly; but science has not
            yet ascended to such an altitude as this amongst the honourable corporation of snobs, on
            whose shoulders the whole guilt of this wonderful apparition is very unjustly laid.</p>
         <p>The ghost is generally about the size of a man, but it takes various forms. Sometimes it
            has the shape of a bear, sometimes it jumps like a kangaroo, and very frequently it is
            dressed like one of the knights of Jerusalem, in shining bring armour, which gleams with
            a white light, like phosphorus. We saw a man who told us that, being at <placeName
               ref="#ilford">Ilford</placeName> one day, he met a man who told him he had fallen in
            love with a woman who positively assured him that she knew a girl who had fairly lost
            her old wits by the sight of the ghost, and had been provided with a new set of wits so
            entirely different that it was hard to believe she was the same person. A servant girl
            in <placeName ref="#kensington">Kensington</placeName>, we are informed, has been so
            powerfully affected that her person has swelled so enormously that her mistress has
            dismissed her as unfit for houshold work. A gentleman in Hammersmith has horns growing
            on his head, which are generally supposed to be produced by one of <rs ref="springheeledjack">Springheeled Jack's</rs>
            incantations. But the strangest rumour of all is this, that the present hard frost is
            owing to the immense consumption of heat by the apparition, which, having lately left
            the furnace underneath presented such an attraction ot the fiery element above, that he
            has absorbed it all for his own private satisfaction, leaving us to experience the same
            shivering sensation which he felt himself when he came up amongst us.</p>
         <p>We have been privately informed that there are Thugs in England; and several in Ireland;
            and that the Thugs in Irelande have joined the Trades' Associations, and are <rs ref="or">privately
            proselytizing the sons of Erin to the worship of Kalee</rs>. <rs ref="springheeledjack">This
               report, which is believed in certain circles, has probably given rise to the rumour,
               which we lately heard repeated by a respectable gentleman, that Springheeled Jack was
               a Thug.</rs> <rs ref="or">It is well known that the Thugs pride themselves in killing without
            shedding blood. The Irish do not understand this doctrine. It seems so unnatural.</rs> The
            Thugs have, therefore, experienced considerable difficulty in the Green Isle in
            propagating their principles. In this country it seemed impossible to pursue their
            favourite system of social amelioration, on account of the vigilance of the police.
            <rs ref="or">They, therefore, so says the report, have resorted to this ghostly method of sacrificing
            to their favourite Kalee, the goddess of bloodless death.</rs></p>
         <p><rs ref="doubt">We have no faith in this idle tale</rs>; but we can assure our readers that we have heard,
            from a respectable quarter, that a woman has brought forth a child with horns on its
            head, and sharp-pointed nails on its fingers. The father swears it is not his, and the
            wife quotes the Poor Law Amendment Bill to prove that it is. <rs ref="rel">We hope the Bishop of
            London is exercising his ghostly jurisdiction in the diocese</rs>. Mayhap this Springheeled
            Jack is the doctor himself. Darkness is the natural element of a Bishop. No man burneth
            a candle in daylight. And as Bishops are candles, they are made only for dark times, and
            dark places, being entirely extinguished when the broad glare of the day-star beams upon
            them. Bishops were very luminous in the dark ages. Now-a-days one can scarcely see them.
            They are like fires which the sun-beams have played upon. It is natural enough that
            these men should desire to restore their ghostly attendants, whose services he can at
            all times command to carry out his spiritual plans of ecclesiastical government. Now the
            ghost is evidently a combination of individuals. It is seen in <placeName ref="#kensington">Kensington</placeName>, <placeName ref="#hammersmith">Hammersmith</placeName>,
            <placeName ref="#ilford">Ilford</placeName>, <placeName ref="#peckham">Peckham</placeName>, <placeName ref="#highgate">Highgate</placeName>, and <placeName ref="#greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>, at one and the same time. <rs ref="rel pol">The most natural
            inference, therefore, is that it is a clerical manoeuvre</rs>. The churches, we understand,
            have been rather better attended on account of it, and we ourselves have heard of one
            woman who was so frightened that she went to church on Sunday last to charm away the
            evil one from herself and children, who had not been in church for twelvemonths
            previous.</p>
         <p>But how to account for the <emph>springing</emph> is difficult. There is something
            beyond flesh and blood, and clerical manoeuvering, in this. There must be a real ghost
            in pay somehow. This we are told is now not so difficult as it has been for a century or
            two. Astrology is reviving. We know several sorcerers in London, and one man assured us
            that he has raised hosts of devils, and made them sit till he drew their pictures. He
            also showed us the pictures of several, and amongst the rest <emph>Cashiel</emph> riding
            on a dragon, a fierce looking fellow. He bring sthem up in a glass, but he thinks it not
            impossible for a parson to make them move about in the open air.</p>
         <p>Now the girl at <placeName ref="#ilford">Ilford</placeName> swears that she saw the moon through the ghost's head.</p>
         <p>The Lord Mayor has received several important letters on the subject, and promises to do
            his utmost to throw light upon it. But it ain't arsenic candles, we can assure his
            Lordship, that will remove an evil so disastrous as this. The fact is, some people
            ascribe it wholly to the arsenic candles. One servant girl, on opening a door, ahd the
            flame of the candle blowin in her face. She fainted, and fell on the floor: and when she
            recovered, she said she saw a man with an owl's face, all covered with feathers, from
            head to foot. The doctor gave her a turn out, and she is as well as ever; but the candle
            being examined it was found to be a wax-end perhaps one of the Lord Mayor's best. If the
            spirit of arsenic has actually been embodied and personified, it will be a heavy crime
            for the chandlers to answer for. The bar, in our opinion, is more suitable than the
            bench for such gentlemen.</p>
         <p>But two lawyers have kindly offered their services to lay this devil. The Lord Mayor is
            highly gratified with this promised aid. If a lawyer cannot lay the devil, he has little
            faith in a parson. <rs ref="pol rel">But his Lordship is no Christian to talk thus.</rs> <q>If satan cast out
               satan, how can his kingdom stand?</q> It is another manoeuvre to inveigle the public.
            Better employ <persName ref="#josephady">Joseph Ady</persName> at once to hunt it down— or to make a good job of it, with the
            Lord Mayor's forged seal attached to his Commission.</p>
         <p>But we must pause for want of space. Our friend McDougal, is out after this son of the
            mist, and most probably will make important discoveries.</p>
